# BinarySearchTree (BST)

This C program creates a binary search tree (BST) data structure and allows performing various operations on it. 
The program can add elements to the tree, search for a specific value, calculate the average of leaf nodes, and find values greater than a given number.

##Features
Provides a user-friendly menu interface.
Allows adding elements to the tree, searching for a specific value, calculating the average of leaf nodes, and finding values greater than a given number through menu options.
Displays the relevant output after each operation.
The program runs in an infinite loop and continues until the user selects the exit option.

##How to Use

1.Run the program.

2.Follow the options in the menu:

  To add an element, select [1] and enter the desired value.
  To find ranked elements, select [2] and enter the desired tree level.
  To search for a value, select [3] and enter the value you want to search for.
  To calculate the average of leaf nodes, select [4].
  To find values greater than a specific number, select [5] and enter the desired value.
  To exit the program, select [6].

3.You will receive the respective results as output.

Note: This program uses the BST data structure and allows user input instead of a specific dataset. Make sure you have the necessary C compiler environment installed before running the program.
